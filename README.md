# Autonomous Vehicle Infinite Air Time Apparatus (AVIATA)
Our research project for the 2020 NASA University Student Research Challenge (USRC) is an autonomous drone swarm that is capabable of collaboratively carrying a payload and swapping in and out mid-flight, effectively giving the swarm an infinite flight time. Possible applications include long-distance transportation, emergency relief, and any other instances that require heavy payloads and/or long flight times.

This repository focuses on the software aspects of AVIATA, which include inter-drone communication through a mesh network, ground-swarm communication, and a GPS and vision-based docking system for attaching to the payload.

# These are just approximates, and we make things simple by assuming these are constant regardless of the number of drones on the structure
# TODO Maybe it's not too much trouble to calculate these for different configurations of drones
M = 1 # mass of the structure + drones + payload in kg
I = np.array([1, 1, 1]) # moment of inertia of the structure + drones + payload in kg*m^2 TODO how does moment of inertia even work
